# # **TikTok Project**
# **Course 6 - The Nuts and bolts of machine learning**

# Recall that you are a data professional at TikTok. Your supervisor was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model that can be used to determine whether a video contains a claim or whether it offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
# 
# A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

# # **Course 6 End-of-course project: Classifying videos using machine learning**
# 
# In this activity, you will practice using machine learning techniques to predict on a binary outcome variable.
# <br/>
# 
# **The purpose** of this model is to increase response time and system efficiency by automating the initial stages of the claims process.
# 
# **The goal** of this model is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or presents an "opinion".
# <br/>
# 
# *This activity has three parts:*
# 
# **Part 1:** Ethical considerations
# * Consider the ethical implications of the request
# 
# * Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

# **Part 2:** Feature engineering
# 
# * Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling
# 
# **Part 3:** Modeling
# 
# * Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps

# 
# # **PACE stages**
# 

# Throughout these project notebooks, you'll see references to the problem-solving framework PACE. The following notebook components are labeled with the respective PACE stage: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute.

# <img src="images/Plan.png" width="100" height="100" align=left>
# 
# 
# ## **PACE: Plan**
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Plan stage.
# 
# In this stage, consider the following questions:
# 
# 
# 1.   **What are you being asked to do? What metric should I use to evaluate success of my business/organizational objective?**
# 
# 2.   **What are the ethical implications of the model? What are the consequences of your model making errors?**
#   *   What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false negative (i.e., when the model says a video does not contain a claim and it actually does)?
# 
#   *   What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false positive (i.e., when the model says a video does contain a claim and it actually does not)?
# 
# 3.   **How would you proceed?**
# 

# **1. What are you being asked to do?
# 
# Business need and modeling objective
# 
# TikTok users can report videos that they believe violate the platform's terms of service. Because there are millions of TikTok videos created and viewed every day, this means that many videos get reportedâ€”too many to be individually reviewed by a human moderator.
# 
# Analysis indicates that when authors do violate the terms of service, they're much more likely to be presenting a claim than an opinion. Therefore, it is useful to be able to determine which videos make claims and which videos are opinions.
# 
# TikTok wants to build a machine learning model to help identify claims and opinions. Videos that are labeled opinions will be less likely to go on to be reviewed by a human moderator. Videos that are labeled as claims will be further sorted by a downstream process to determine whether they should get prioritized for review. For example, perhaps videos that are classified as claims would then be ranked by how many times they were reported, then the top x% would be reviewed by a human each day.
# 
# A machine learning model would greatly assist in the effort to present human moderators with videos that are most likely to be in violation of TikTok's terms of service.
# 
# Modeling design and target variable
# 
# The data dictionary shows that there is a column called claim_status. This is a binary value that indicates whether a video is a claim or an opinion. This will be the target variable. In other words, for each video, the model should predict whether the video is a claim or an opinion.
# 
# This is a classification task because the model is predicting a binary class.
# 
# Select an evaluation metric
# 
# To determine which evaluation metric might be best, consider how the model might be wrong. There are two possibilities for bad predictions:
# 
# False positives: When the model predicts a video is a claim when in fact it is an opinion
# False negatives: When the model predicts a video is an opinion when in fact it is a claim
# **2. What are the ethical implications of building the model? In the given scenario, it's better for the model to predict false positives when it makes a mistake, and worse for it to predict false negatives. It's very important to identify videos that break the terms of service, even if that means some opinion videos are misclassified as claims. The worst case for an opinion misclassified as a claim is that the video goes to human review. The worst case for a claim that's misclassified as an opinion is that the video does not get reviewed and it violates the terms of service. A video that violates the terms of service would be considered posted from a "banned" author, as referenced in the data dictionary.
# 
# Because it's more important to minimize false negatives, the model evaluation metric will be recall.
# 
# **3. How would you proceed?

# **Modeling workflow and model selection process**
# 
# Previous work with this data has revealed that there are ~20,000 videos in the sample. This is sufficient to conduct a rigorous model validation workflow, broken into the following steps:
# 
# 1. Split the data into train/validation/test sets (60/20/20)
# 2. Fit models and tune hyperparameters on the training set
# 3. Perform final model selection on the validation set
# 4. Assess the champion model's performance on the test set

# **Question:** Describe your most predictive features. Were your results surprising?

# ### **Task 8. Conclusion**
# 
# In this step use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:
# 
# 1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**
# 
# 2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**
# 
# 3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**
# 
# 4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**
# 
# Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion.
