# # Activity: Structure your data 

# ## Introduction
# 
# In this activity, you will practice structuring, an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** step that helps data science projects move forward. During EDA, when working with data that contains aspects of date and time, "datetime" transformations are integral to better understanding the data. As a data professional, you will encounter datetime transformations quite often as you determine how to format your data to suit the problems you want to solve or the questions you want to answer. This activity gives you an opportunity to apply these skills and prepare you for future EDA, where you will need to determine how best to structure your data.
# 
# In this activity, you are a member of an analytics team that provides insights to an investing firm. To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into **unicorn companies**â€“companies that are valued at over one billion dollars.  
# 
# You will work with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help you draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, you will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns you find in the dataset. This will develop your skills in EDA and your knowledge of functions that allow you to structure data.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# ## Step 1: Imports 

# ### Import relevant libraries and modules
# 
# Import the relevant Python libraries and modules that you will need to use. In this activity, you will use `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

# In[1]:


# Import the relevant Python libraries and modules needed in this lab.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import datetime as dt


# ### Load the dataset into a DataFrame
# 
# The dataset provided is in the form of a csv file named `Unicorn_Companies.csv` and contains a subset of data on unicorn companies. As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.

# In[2]:


# RUN THIS CELL TO IMPORT YOUR DATA.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
companies = pd.read_csv("Unicorn_Companies.csv")


# ## Step 2: Data exploration
# 

# ### Display the first 10 rows of the data
# 
# In this section, you will discover what the dataset entails and answer questions to guide your exploration and analysis of the data. This is an important step in EDA. 
# 
# To begin, display the first 10 rows of the data to get an understanding of how the dataset is structured.

# ### Visualize the time it took companies to reach unicorn status
# 
# In this section, you will evaluate the result of structuring the data, making observations, and gaining further insights about the data. 
# 
# Using the `companies` dataset, create a bar plot to visualize the average number of years it took companies to reach unicorn status with respect to when they were founded.

# **Question:** What trends do you notice in the data? Specifically, consider companies that were founded later on. How long did it take those companies to reach unicorn status?
# 

# 1919 is most valuable data of unicorn joined.

# ### Visualize the number of companies that joined per interval

# **Question:** What do you observe from the bar plot of the number of companies that joined per interval for the year of 2021? When did the highest number of companies reach $1 billion valuation?

# ### Visualize the average valuation over the quarters
# 
# Using the subset of companies that joined in the years of interest, create a grouped bar plot to visualize the average valuation over the quarters, with two bars for each time interval. There will be two bars for each time interval. This allows you to compare quarterly values between the two years.

# In[39]:


# Using slicing, extract the year component and the time interval that you specified, 
# and save them by adding two new columns into the subset.
