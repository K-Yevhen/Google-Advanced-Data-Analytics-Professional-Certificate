# # Activity: Explore descriptive statistics

# ## **Introduction**
# 
# Data professionals often use descriptive statistics to understand the data they are working with and provide collaborators with a summary of the relative location of values in the data, as well an information about its spread. 
# 
# For this activity, you are a member of an analytics team for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). You are assigned to analyze data on air quality with respect to carbon monoxide, a major air pollutant. The data includes information from more than 200 sites, identified by state, county, city, and local site names. You will use Python functions to gather statistics about air quality, then share insights with stakeholders.

# ## **Step 1: Imports** 
# 

# Import the relevant Python libraries `pandas` and `numpy`.

# In[1]:


# Import relevant Python libraries.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


# The dataset provided is in the form of a .csv file named `c4_epa_air_quality.csv`. It contains a subset of data from the U.S. EPA. As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.

# In[2]:


# RUN THIS CELL TO IMPORT YOUR DATA.

### YOUR CODE HERE
epa_data = pd.read_csv("c4_epa_air_quality.csv", index_col = 0)

#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Refer to the video about loading data in Python.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
#   There is a function in the `pandas` library that allows you to read in data from a .csv file and load it into a DataFrame. 
# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
#   Use the `read_csv` function from the pandas `library`. The `index_col` parameter can be set to `0` to read in the first column as an index (and to avoid `"Unnamed: 0"` appearing as a column in the resulting DataFrame).
# 
# </details>

# ## **Step 2: Data exploration** 

# To understand how the dataset is structured, display the first 10 rows of the data.

# In[3]:


# Display first 10 rows of the data.

### YOUR CODE HERE

# 
# </details>

# **Question:** What does the `aqi` column represent?

# Air Quality Index

# Now, get a table that contains some descriptive statistics about the data.

# In[4]:


# Get descriptive stats.

### YOUR CODE HERE
epa_data.describe()


# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
#

# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
#

# **Question:** What do you notice about the 25th percentile for the `aqi` column?
# 
# 

# the 25th percentile for the aqi column is 2

# 
# This is another important measure for understanding where the aqi values lie. 

# the 75th percentile for the `aqi` column is 9

# 
# </details>

# <details>
#   <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
#  Use the `describe()` function from the `pandas` library. Note that this function can be used:
# - "on a DataFrame (to find descriptive statistics about the numeric columns)" 
# - "directly on a column containing categorical data (to find pertinent descriptive statistics)"
# 
# </details>

# **Question:** What do you notice while reviewing the descriptive statistics about the states in the data? 
# 
# Note: Sometimes you have to individually calculate statistics. To review to that approach, use the `numpy` library to calculate each of the main statistics in the preceding table for the `aqi` column.

# 260 states are presented, 52 states are unique, most popular state is Califoria with frequency 66.

# ## **Considerations**
# 

# **What are some key takeaways that you learned during this lab?**

# [Write your response here. Double-click (or enter) to edit.]

# **How would you present your findings from this lab to others? Consider the following relevant points noted by AirNow.gov as you respond:**
# - "AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy—at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values increase."
# - "An AQI of 100 for carbon monoxide corresponds to a level of 9.4 parts per million."

# The average AQI value in the data is approximately 6.76, which is considered safe with respect to carbon monoxide. Further, 75% of the AQI values are below 9.

# **What summary would you provide to stakeholders? Use the same information provided previously from AirNow.gov as you respond.**

# 75% of the AQI values in the data are below 9, which is considered good air quality.
# Funding should be allocated for further investigation of the less healthy regions in order to learn how to improve the conditions.
